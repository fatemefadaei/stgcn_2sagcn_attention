# stgcn_2sagcn_attention
This code repository is related to two STGCN and TWO SAGCN networks, to which Attention has been added and has given better results.
Both networks are first stored with NTU RGB D skeletal data trained by weights and then trained with Kinect camera skeletal data labeled by the doctor in pkl format. The Attention module has been added to the residual layer and has improved the results.

If you use the mmaction2 framework, the results will be better.
